# üß™ ppchemproject 
# The following package ‚ú® : 
- Validates input SMILES strings for their correctness.
- Calculates molecular weight, number of atoms, number of bonds, molecular formula.
- Generates 2D and 3D interactive representations of the molecular structure.
- Extracts additional information about the compound from a PubChem dataset (encompassing more than 100'000 molecules), giving the IUPAC name, exact mass as well as monoisotopic mass.
- The following chemical tools are used: Python, RDKit, pandas, py3Dmol, Jupyter Lab
